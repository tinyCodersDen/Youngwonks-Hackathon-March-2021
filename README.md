# Hackathon-March-2021
Hello! My name is Vihan and this is my repo for the Youngwonks Hackathon on March 6,2021. For the thematic project, I made a Space World Dashboard.
The Hackathon.py is for the code, the other csv files are for the datasets. I am using plotly and dash, so you may have to do a pip install dash.

Happy Coding!
Vihan
